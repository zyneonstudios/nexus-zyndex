# Getting started...
There are several ways to set up a Zyndex. You can actually do almost all of these steps easily with a text program, here we explain three ways to set up a Zyndex:

## ...with a text program {collapsible="true"}
> Warning: It is NOT recommended to do it this way, it's just here because you can actually do it with pretty much any computer. But if you have the opportunity to choose one of the other paths, it's best to do that.

### Step 1 - Create a folder
Create a new folder somewhere where you can remember it (for example on the desktop) and name it, for example: "Zyndex" and then open this folder.

### Step 2 - Create Index JSON File
In this folder, create a new file called `index.json`. It is very important that the file actually has this name, as this is considered the endpoint for the Zyndex.
The directory structure should now look like this:
```    
    New Created Folder "Zyndex"
        â•š index.json
```

### Step 3 - Add the basic layout to the file
Now open the new `index.json` file with Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (macOS) or your standard text editor.

Copy the following into `index.json`:
```
{
  "name": "New unnamed Zyndex",
  "url": "https://url.to.zyndex/index.json",
  "owner": "Anonymous",
  "instances": []
}
```

### Step 4 - Correct the values
Enter your information to correct the values in the file. Change the following values.<br><br>
`name`: Enter what you want your Zyndex to be called.<br>
`url`: Enter the address through which your Zyndex should later be accessible.<br>
`owner`: Enter here what the group or person behind the Zyndex is called.<br><br>
As an example, let's now take the `name` "Muster", the `url` "https://example.com/zyndex/index.json" and the `owner` "Mustermann".
```
#WARNING: These are example values!

{
  "name": "Muster",
  "url": "https://example.com/zyndex/index.json",
  "owner": "Mustermann",
  "instances": []
}
```
{collapsible="true"}

### Step 5 - Save & that's it!
Now save the file and keep the name index.json and path of your new folder.
So you have already created a local Zyndex.
This doesn't yet have any instances, resources, etc. and can't be accessed from the internet yet, but in the base you have an empty, fresh, new and above all: your own Zyndex!

> Next you could start with instances, resources, mods and; or add more to your Zyndex. Or you can try getting your Zyndex online.

## ...with JetBrains IDEA {collapsible="true"}
> **Prerequisites:**<br>
> Any IDE from JetBrains like IntelliJ.<br>
> As an example, we are working with IntelliJ Community Edition here.<br>
> [Download](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/idea/download/download-thanks.html?code=IIC) [Website](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/idea)

### Step 1 - Create new empty project
Open IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition and create a new empty project. Enter the name and location you want to use.<br>
Leave create git repository unchecked.

### Step 2 - Create the index.json file
Right-click on your project in your project explorer. Navigate to "New" and then select "File".
Name the file `index.json`. It is very important that the file has the same name as this file will be the endpoint for your Zyndex.

### Step 3 - Create basic layout
Copy the following text into your index.json:
```
{
  "name": "New unnamed Zyndex",
  "url": "https://url.to.zyndex/index.json",
  "owner": "Anonymous",
  "instances": []
}
```

### Step 4 - Correct all values
Enter your information to correct the values in the file. Change the following values.<br><br>
`name`: Enter what you want your Zyndex to be called.<br>
`url`: Enter the address through which your Zyndex should later be accessible.<br>
`owner`: Enter here what the group or person behind the Zyndex is called.<br><br>
As an example, let's now take the `name` "Muster", the `url` "https://example.com/zyndex/index.json" and the `owner` "Mustermann".
```
#WARNING: These are example values!

{
  "name": "Muster",
  "url": "https://example.com/zyndex/index.json",
  "owner": "Mustermann",
  "instances": []
}
```
{collapsible="true"}

### That's it!
Complete! You now have your own Zyndex.<br>
So far you can't do anything with it because there's no content yet and it's not yet accessible from the internet.<br>
But you have set up a basic Zyndex - Congratulations!

## ...with Visual Studio Code {collapsible="true"}

### Step 1 - Create a new folder
Create a new folder somewhere you can remember it (for example on the desktop) and name it "Zyndex", for example.

### Step 2 - Open Visual Studio Code
Open VS Code and click "File" in the toolbar and then click "Open folder". From there, select the folder you just created.

### Step 3 - Create the index.json
Right-click in the empty field under your folder name and click "New File...". Name the file `index.json`, it is very important that this file is named the same as this is considered the endpoint for your Zyndex.

### Step 4 - Create basic layout
Copy the following text into your index.json:
```
{
  "name": "New unnamed Zyndex",
  "url": "https://url.to.zyndex/index.json",
  "owner": "Anonymous",
  "instances": []
}
```

### Step 5 - Correct all values
Enter your information to correct the values in the file. Change the following values.<br><br>
`name`: Enter what you want your Zyndex to be called.<br>
`url`: Enter the address through which your Zyndex should later be accessible.<br>
`owner`: Enter here what the group or person behind the Zyndex is called.<br><br>
As an example, let's now take the `name` "Muster", the `url` "https://example.com/zyndex/index.json" and the `owner` "Mustermann".

  "name": "Muster",
  "url": "https://example.com/zyndex/index.json",
  "owner": "Mustermann",
  "instances": []
}
```

### Step 6 - Save & That's it!
In VS Code, while you have the index.json open, click "File" in the toolbar and then click "Save" or save the document using the shortcut.
